In this example, we have two shows and the first show will play in its entirety progressing from specials through all seasons, and only then will the next show start playing. </p> <p></p> <p>If we instead wanted this similar to what we'd see on traditional television, select \"SORT\" and choose either Block Shuffle or Cyclic Shuffle. </p> <p></p> <p>Block Shuffle will play a specific number of episodes from a show, proceed to the next show, play that same number of episodes, proceed to the next show, etc. </p> <p>By default, when a show completes airing, it will be absent from your schedule until all of the remaining shows complete airing, where the schedule will then be repeated. This means that as you reach the end of your schedule, it may be dominated by one or two shows that have a longer runtime or more episodes than others.</p> <p>To get around this, select \"Make perfect schedule loop\". This will attempt to have all shows complete airing at the same time.</p> <p></p> <p>Please note the perfect schedule loop option does not currently support larger channels. If you see the below error, your channel has too many episodes to use this feature. In this case, the \"Loop Short Programs\" option can be used.</p> <p></p> <p>Cyclic Shuffle will alternate between shows while attempting to preserve the episode sequence. So in this example, it will play S00E01 from show 1, then play S00E01-E02 from show 2, then S01E01-E02 from show 1, then S01E01 from show 2, etc. Compared to Block Schedule, Cyclic Shuffle is randomized, so it will not always display the same number of episodes from a show. Cyclic Shuffle also does not support any features to create even blocks, so the end of your schedule will likely be dominated by a few shows with larger episode counts and runtime. </p> <p>Once you have a channel created with programming, you are ready to setup your Client and start using Tunarr!</p>"},{"location":"configure/transcoding/","title":"Transcoding","text":""},{"location":"configure/channels/","title":"Channels","text":"<p>This page will display a brief overview of your channels. </p> <p>Click the \"NEW\" button to be brought to the New Channel Properties page.</p> <p></p> <p>Once you have created your first channel, head over to Programming to start adding episodes. </p>"},{"location":"configure/channels/epg/","title":"EPG","text":"<p>TBD</p>"},{"location":"configure/channels/flex/","title":"Flex","text":"<p>Flex is an optional block of time that is used to separate two episodes of television.

Here a few of the common ones we've seen:</p> <ol> <li>If using Docker, you are not using the appropriate image tag.

For iGPUs, like Intel GPUs, the <code>*-vaapi</code> Docker images are required.</li> <li>The <code>ffmpeg</code> executable used by Tunarr is not correct. Double-check the executable path configured by Tunarr with the one in your CLI environment (<code>which ffmpeg</code>). One example of this running on Ubuntu and having installed a version of ffmpeg with <code>snap</code> (executable in <code>/snap/bin/ffmpeg</code>) and one with <code>apt</code> (in <code>/usr/bin/ffmpeg</code>).</li> <li>The <code>ffmpeg</code> executable you are using does not have the necessary libraries compiled in.
